        Our Beach Cleanup Initiative
      </h2>
      <p>
        Lake Victoria is not just a body of water — it is the heartbeat of
        countless lives. Fishermen cast their nets each morning, children play
        along its shores, and entire communities depend on it for food, water,
        and livelihood. Yet, this lifeline faces a growing threat: plastic
        pollution.
      </p>
      <p>
        In partnership with <strong>Osiepe Sango CBO</strong> and <strong
          >Kenya Shipyards Limited</strong
        >, ICAN took part in a transformative cleanup at <strong
          >Usoma Beach, Kisumu Central Subcounty</strong
        >. The day began with a community <em>debrief</em> — an eye-opening discussion
        about the types of waste polluting the lake and how it impacts both humans
        and aquatic life.
      </p>
      <p>
        Participants then moved into action: sorting waste by type, collecting
        it along the shoreline, weighing the totals, and ensuring it was
        transported to plastic management companies for recycling. This wasn't
        just about picking trash — it was about protecting life.

      <p>
        As the sun dipped low over the lake, the shoreline looked different —
        cleaner, calmer, almost grateful. Children who had spent the day helping
        smiled as they carried small bags of collected plastics. For them, this
        wasn’t just an event — it was a lesson in love for the only lake they’ve
        ever known.

        Clean water is more than an environmental concern; it is a matter of
        dignity, health, and survival. ICAN remains committed to championing <strong
          >SDG 6 – Clean Water and Sanitation</strong
        > and
        <strong>SDG 14 – Life Below Water</strong> through tangible, community-led
        action.
