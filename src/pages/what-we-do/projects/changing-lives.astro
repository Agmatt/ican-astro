            One Pad at a Time: Inside Our School Sanitary Drive
          </p>

          <p class='mb-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed'>
            Picture this: a classroom full of bright young girls, their eyes
            lighting up not just with curiosity—but with confidence. That was
            the scene at our recent school sanitary pad drive, where something
            powerful happened. We didn’t just hand out supplies—we sparked
            conversations, challenged taboos, and helped transform the way these
            girls see themselves and their futures.
          </p>

          <p class='mb-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed'>
            The day began with an interactive workshop that turned shy glances
            and hushed whispers about menstruation into open, fearless dialogue.
            With the help of our incredible team and dedicated volunteers, we
            created a safe, judgment-free space where questions were encouraged
            and myths were debunked. The atmosphere was electric as girls began
            to realize: periods aren’t something to be ashamed of—they’re a
            natural, strong, and shared part of womanhood.
          </p>

          <p class='mb-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed'>
            One girl who barely whispered her name at the start of the day came
            up to us later, glowing with pride. “I used to think periods were
            something to hide,” she said. “Now I feel proud.” That’s the kind of
            change we live for—real, lasting impact made one conversation, one
            smile, one pad at a time.
          </p>

            Join us. Whether it’s through donating, volunteering, or simply
            sharing this story, you can be part of the change. Let’s rewrite the
            narrative around menstrual health—together.
          </p>

          <p class='mb-4 font-semibold text-gray-800'>
            Because every girl deserves to feel proud. Every girl deserves to
            stay in school. And every girl deserves the chance to shine.
