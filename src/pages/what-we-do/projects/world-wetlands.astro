            Tree Planting at Tom Mboya University
          </p>

          <p class='mb-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed'>
            Inuana Community Action Network (ICAN) joined hands with students,
            faculty, and diverse stakeholders at Tom Mboya University in Homa
            Bay County, Kenya, to mark World Wetlands Day. This vibrant event,
            held on February 2, 2025, was a powerful testament to our shared
            commitment to preserving wetlands and fostering sustainable
            communities.

          <p class='mb-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed'>
            The day was filled with energy and purpose as ICAN members connected
            with environmental activists, local leaders, and university
            representatives. Together, we rolled up our sleeves and planted
            trees around the university grounds, contributing to the restoration
            of vital ecosystems. Wetlands, often called the "kidneys of the
            earth," play a critical role in water purification, flood control,
            and biodiversity. By planting trees, we aimed to enhance these
            natural systems, combat climate change, and create greener spaces
            for future generations.

            The event was more than just planting trees—it was a celebration of
            collaboration. Conversations buzzed with ideas for sustainable
            practices, from wetland conservation to youth-led environmental
            initiatives. Stakeholders shared insights on the challenges facing
            wetlands in Homa Bay, sparking inspiration for ICAN’s ongoing
            mission to empower communities through health, youth engagement, and
            environmental action.

            As the sun set over Tom Mboya University, the newly planted trees
            stood as symbols of hope and unity. ICAN is proud to have been part
            of this meaningful day, and we’re more determined than ever to
            continue our work in environmental advocacy and community
            empowerment. Join us in our journey to protect our planet and uplift
            Homa Bay—because together, we can make a lasting impact!
