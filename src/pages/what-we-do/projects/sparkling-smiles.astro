            Our Joyful Oral Hygiene Drive at Pedo Primary
          </p>

          <p class='mb-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed'>
            At Pedo Primary School, something magical happened—an ordinary day
            turned into an unforgettable celebration of health, happiness, and
            radiant smiles. Our recent oral hygiene drive wasn’t just about
            toothbrushes and toothpaste—it was about inspiring young minds to
            take pride in their well-being and shine from the inside out.
          </p>

          <p class='mb-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed'>
            We kicked off with a lively, hands-on workshop that transformed
            dental care into a fun-filled adventure. With the help of our
            enthusiastic team and dedicated volunteers, the students learned how
            to brush like pros, floss with confidence, and keep their smiles
            sparkling. We busted common myths, answered curious questions, and
            turned dental hygiene into something exciting and empowering. The
            classroom buzzed with laughter, raised hands, and wide-eyed wonder.

          <p class='mb-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed'>
            Then came the moment that lit up the entire schoolyard: every child
            received a brand-new toothbrush and a tube of minty-fresh
            toothpaste. But these weren’t just dental supplies—they were bright
            tokens of self-care, confidence, and the belief that every child
            deserves to feel good about themselves. The energy was contagious as
            the students clutched their colorful kits, eager to start a new
            brushing routine that felt more like a superpower than a chore.
          </p>
          <p class='mb-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed'>
            One shy little girl, holding her bright blue toothbrush close, said
            something that melted our hearts: “I’m going to make my smile the
            best in class!” Her eyes sparkled with pride and determination—and
            in that moment, we knew this drive had made a lasting impact.
          </p>
          <p class='mb-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed'>
            Our visit to Pedo Primary wasn’t just a one-time event. It was a
            promise to these children that their health matters, that their
            smiles are worth celebrating, and that their futures deserve
            investment and care.
          </p>
          <p class='mb-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed'>
            Now we need you. Help us keep this momentum going—whether it’s
            through donating, volunteering, or simply sharing this story, you
            can help us bring more smiles to more schools, one toothbrush at a
            time.
          </p>

          <p class='mb-4 font-bold text-gray-800'>
            Together, let’s make sure every child has a reason to smile—and the
            tools to make it shine.
