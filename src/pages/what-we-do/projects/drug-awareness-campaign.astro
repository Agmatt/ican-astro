        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          The Homabay Community Workgroup (HCW) is a network of active
          community-based and non-governmental organisations committed to
          driving positive change in Homabay County. On <strong
            >{reportDate}</strong
          >, HCW—together with <strong>ICAN</strong> and with the support of
          <strong> NACADA</strong>—responded to a call from St. Augustine Mirogi
          Boys High School to address a growing crisis: drug and substance abuse
          among students.
        </p>
        <p>
          This report is both a record of that day’s activities and a call to
          action. It captures the voices, concerns, and hopes of a school
          community determined to reclaim the future of its youth.
        </p>

        <h2 class='my-6'>2. Problem Statement</h2>
        <p>
          Substance abuse in secondary schools is no longer an isolated
          problem—it is a community crisis. At Mirogi Boys High School, cases of
          cannabis, smokeless tobacco, alcohol, and psychoactive inhalants had
          risen sharply. Beyond health risks, these behaviors were eroding
          academic performance, fueling stigma, and fracturing family
          relationships.
        </p>

        <h2 class='my-6'>3. Literature Review</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>NACADA (2022)</strong>: Cannabis, prescription drug misuse,
            and smokeless tobacco are increasingly common in rural schools.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>KDHS (2022)</strong>: Substance abuse correlates with rising
            adolescent reproductive health challenges, untreated STIs, and
            mental health disorders.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>MOH Adolescent Health Policy (2015)</strong>: Calls for
            community-led interventions to reduce risky behaviors and promote
            adolescent well-being.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class='my-6'>4. Objectives of the Campaign</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Primary Objective:</strong> Create awareness and equip the school
          with strategies to address root causes of drug abuse.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Secondary Objectives:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Engage students in open, stigma-free discussions.</li>
          <li>Identify the types and sources of abused substances.</li>
          <li>Understand impacts on mental health and academics.</li>
          <li>Explore related sexual reproductive health (SRH) concerns.</li>
          <li>Initiate stakeholder-driven follow-up actions.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class='my-6'>5. Methodology</h2>
        <p>The campaign used a participatory, student-centered approach:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Preliminary engagement with school administration.</li>
          <li>Stakeholder briefing for alignment and support.</li>
          <li>Age-segmented student groups for tailored discussions.</li>
          <li>
            Participatory group discussions using real stories and testimonies.
          </li>
          <li>Analysis of student and teacher input.</li>
          <li>Debrief with school leaders to co-create next steps.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2 class='my-6'>6. Key Findings</h2>
        <h3>A. Drug and Substance Abuse</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Most abused: Bhang, “mbazi” (inhalants), kuber, and alcohol.</li>
          <li>
            Highest incidence: Form 4 students—peer influence, academic stress,
            lax supervision.
          </li>
          <li>
            Most initiation happens <strong>within</strong> school premises.
          </li>
          <li>100+ drug-related incidents in the past academic year.</li>
          <li>
            Psychosocial consequences: stigma, withdrawal, anxiety, depression.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class='my-6'>B. Sexual Reproductive Health Issues</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Untreated/recurrent STIs, UTIs among students.</li>
          <li>Lack of access to proper healthcare and treatment.</li>
          <li>Stigma compounds mental health struggles.</li>
          <li>
            Drivers: poor hygiene, sexual activity within school, lack of school
            clinic.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class='my-6'>7. Root Cause Analysis</h2>
        <p>
          Using the “5 Whys” technique, the investigation revealed the lack of
          effective monitoring, poor frisking practices, overburdened staff, and
          absence of a comprehensive school drug policy.
        </p>

        <h2>8. Conclusion & Recommendations</h2>
        <p>
          The campaign achieved its immediate awareness goal but also exposed
          urgent systemic needs: stronger policy, better monitoring, healthcare
          access, and sustained stakeholder collaboration. The recommended next
          step is a <strong>Free Comprehensive Medical Camp</strong> for reproductive
          and mental health screening and treatment.
