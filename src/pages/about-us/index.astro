        <strong>ICAN</strong> is a community-based organization founded by active,
        dedicated, and committed youths in 2022. It is fully registered under the
        Civil Society of Kenya within the State Department for Social Protection.
      </p>
      <p class='text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6'>
        ICAN has grown to over 30 members by 2024, including students,
        freelancers, healthcare workers, and social workers across Siaya,
        Kisumu, and Homabay Counties. Though diverse in background, all share a
        common vision of healthy, empowered Kenyan communities.
      </p>
      <p class='text-lg text-gray-700'>
        Our aim is to improve community wellbeing and address health, economic,

          Our Roots
        </h3>
        <p class='mb-5 text-gray-800 leading-relaxed'>
          In the vibrant heart of Homa Bay Town, Kenya, a group of passionate
          youths ignited a movement for change. As the Inuana Community
          Organization, they championed health, youth empowerment, and community
          unity with a vision to transform lives.
        </p>
        <p class='mb-5 text-gray-800 leading-relaxed'>
          A pivotal moment came when they met three like-minded individuals who
          shared their dream but lacked a platform. This alliance of passion and
          expertise laid the foundation for a new chapter.
        </p>
        <p class='text-gray-800 leading-relaxed'>
          Thus, the Inuana Community Organization evolved into the
          <strong>Inuana Community Action Network (ICAN)</strong>, a registered
          entity with a broader mission. Today, with a vibrant and diverse
          membership, ICAN continues to champion youth empowerment, health
          equity, and inclusive community growth.
