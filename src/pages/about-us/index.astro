          Our Roots
        </h3>
        <p class='mb-5 text-gray-800 leading-relaxed'>
          In the vibrant heart of Homa Bay Town, Kenya, a group of passionate
          youths ignited a movement for change. As the Inuana Community
          Organization, they championed health, youth empowerment, and community
          unity with a vision to transform lives.
        </p>
        <p class='mb-5 text-gray-800 leading-relaxed'>
          A pivotal moment came when they met three like-minded individuals who
          shared their dream but lacked a platform. This alliance of passion and
          expertise laid the foundation for a new chapter.
        </p>
        <p class='text-gray-800 leading-relaxed'>
          Thus, the Inuana Community Organization evolved into the
          <strong>Inuana Community Action Network (ICAN)</strong>, a registered
          entity with a broader mission. Today, with a vibrant and diverse
          membership, ICAN continues to champion youth empowerment, health
          equity, and inclusive community growth.
